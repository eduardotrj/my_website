					<p>Hello. I originally had a passion for science and the arts, this 
					made me difficult to choose an only one path to my future. I 
					started with the most artistic branch but it was not as 
					attractive a challenge as I thought.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					After some time of traveling, I decided to pour all my passion
					for web development. I have been learning and practice on 
					my own, as much as I could, feeling my passion growing.
					</p>
					
					<p>I can offer a capacity for logical thinking. Very high 
					adaptability thanks to my experience having faced multiple 
					situations in different environments. Creative capacity to 
					improve designs or tackle any problem. And a desire to 
					continue growing.
					</p>
					
					<p>I invite you to discover more about me through my website.</p>

					<p>I have extensive experience working alone or in a team developing a great capacity to search for solutions. In addition, I have been doing research on programming techniques, which has led me to read books such as Clean Code by Robert C. Martin or Design Patterns by Eric and Elisabeth Freeman. 
					</p>
					
					<p>I have also been informed and trained in agile techniques such as SCRUM or Extreme Programming XP.  Techniques such as TDD have been another of the development and testing techniques that I have analysed in detail.
					</p>
					
					<p>Checking the version control programs such as GIT, with the aim of being able to build and update large projects without compromising their stability.
					</p>
					
					<p>Dealing with code I've learned how important it is to organize all the code and follow some guidelines, to facilitate error detection and reuse of that code by myself and other developers.</p>
					
					<p>Finally I would like to add my total availability to travel, being able to manage correctly both in English and Spanish, as well as knowing a little bit of other languages such as Russian.</p>
